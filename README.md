# Lotus tutorial

[Lotus](http://psbweb05.psb.ugent.be/lotus/) is a suite of tools to automatically end efficiently analyze 16S datasets.

This repository contains some documentation and hands out notes (see below), as well as three datasets to practice with (in the [datasets](datasets/) subdirectory).

This workshop focuses on a common triad of tasks: dealing with different input formats/technologies, propagating and making use of metadata (mapping files), and performing the 16S analysis itself.
