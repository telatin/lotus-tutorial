# Using Lotus

## What you need

 * *Input sequences*: a set of sequences (coming from a metabarcoding experiment)
 * A *mapping file*: spreadsheet  with some information about each sample

Sometimes, especially when downloading public datasets (that can be quite outdated), we need to _manipulate_ the raw input in order to be able to process it.
An example is the demultiplexing of a sequencing run using a set of molecular barcodes. Lotus ships its own tool to perform the demultiplexing (sdm, for "simple demultiplexer").

The spreadsheet, usually referred to as _mapping file_, is the glue that links our reads to relevant information (e.g. a sample name, the treatment, ...)
