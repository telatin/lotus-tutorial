# Undemultiplexed Illumina MiSeq run

In the **datasets/miseq** directory you'll find a non demultiplexed Illumina run, where the barcode (index) is saved in a dedicated FASTQ file 
(with the _.mid._ infix).

Use [sdm](../docs/sdm.md) to perform the demultiplexing.

_NOTE:_ This is a very small subsample of the original dataset and it's only proposed to test the demultiplexing procedure
